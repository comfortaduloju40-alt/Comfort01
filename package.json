Velocity AI: 2026 Trading Demo (No-Terminal)

Step 1: GitHub Setup

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Create index.js and paste the updated code from the editor.

Create package.json with this updated content for 2026:

{
  "name": "velocity-ai-2026",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "description": "High-frequency AI trading simulation bot",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "telegraf": "^4.16.3",
    "express": "^5.1.0"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0"
  }
}


Step 2: Render.com Deployment

Create a New Web Service and link your repo.

Environment Variable: Add BOT_TOKEN with your key from @BotFather.

Launch: Render will install these dependencies and start your bot.

Why update the package.json?

Express 5.1.0: This is now the default stable version, offering better performance for the webhooks/keep-alive server.

Node Engine: Explicitly tells Render to use a modern Node.js version (20 or higher) which is required for the latest library features.

Security: Using ^ allows the server to pull the latest security patches within those major versions.
